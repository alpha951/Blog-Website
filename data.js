exports.aboutContent =
  "Hey there, I'm Keshav Carpenter, a newbie developer. I built the initial version of this project under Web Developement bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. It was fun to learn how to deal with database and connect it with your express server. I also discovered that what challanges one might face while deploying an express application on Heroku/vercel or any other cloud server. Thanks to Dr. Angela Yu for creating such an amazing course for beginners. Later on, I learned MVC architecture from John Smilga's course and I refactored the whole project. I also made the website completely responsive in my recent commits. The mongoose queries have been updated to async format. It was a great learning from both of the instructors. I'm very much thankful to John and Angela for their courses. And finally thanks to you for visiting my project. Have a great day ahead and don't forget to add a new post as a gesture of your presence here!";
